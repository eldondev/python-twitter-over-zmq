This is a super-simple little script to create a local pub-sub service for development around

You will need to copy $FILE.sample -> $FILE and replace REPLACEME in those files.

Also practice on signing these oauth-y things.

Depends on python zeromq bindings and pycurl.

Let's pretend it's licensed MIT.
